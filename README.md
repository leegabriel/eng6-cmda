#Commodities Market Analysis
A program to analyze data from the commodities market, and then make predictions based on past performance

<h2>Todo:</h2>
1. Create menu that gives the user the option of analyzing either commodity price indices
or individual commodity prices.
2. Menu should list the options based on the choice the user made in Step 1
3. Based off the user’s selection from the menu in step 2, report to the user the years of
data available for the user’s choice
4. Present the user with a menu of types of graphs to choose from. Your program must
offer all of the following :
<ul>
  <li>The option to plot the price from a single month</li>
  <li>The option to plot the price for every month over a range of years specified by the
user.</li>
  <li>The option to create a bar chart for every quarter (Jan-Mar, Apr-June, July-Sept,
Oct-Dec) for a range of years specified by the user.</li>
  <li>The option to create a bar chart for every year over a range of years specified by the
user.</li>
</ul>
5. Every plot MUST have a title listing the commodity price index or commodity price that
is being plotted and the type of plot (those listed in #4 above)
6. The program must offer the option of predicting the future price of the individual
commodity if the user has chosen one of the following: ­ Crude Oil ­ Copper ­
Aluminum (LME) ­ Cotton ­ Cocoa
7. Carry out the prediction using an exponential moving average (EMA) on the data*
8. Use curve­fitting in order to obtain a “predicted” price.
9. Use your curve­fitting results to generate the “predicted” price for the day the program
is running.
10. Query the Internet

*Also need to devise strategy to deal with sudden and dramatic increase in price
